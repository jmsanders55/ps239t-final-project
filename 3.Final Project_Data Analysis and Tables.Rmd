# 0 Summary of File
The purpose of this file is to perform data analysis and create data tables for the dataset of the Top 100 Recruits from 2010-2020, specifically high school data. 

#1 Setup environment
```{r}
# remove all objects
rm(list=ls())

# check working directory
getwd()

library(pacman)
pacman::p_unload(all)

# Add packages 
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, #ggplot, dplyr, readr, etc.
  ggthemes, #extra themes
  viridis, #great colors
  data.table, #fread() 
  foreign, #load data types including stata .dta files 
  magrittr, #%<>% operator
  skimr, #for summerising
  stargazer, #pretty tables 
  xtable, #pretty tables 
  knitr, #pretty tables (kable)
  kable,
  kableExtra #KableExtra
  
)
```

#2 Load Data 
```{r}
bar_graph_data <- read.csv("/Users/jasminesanders/Desktop/Berkeley/Spring 2020/239T Intro to Computational Tools/Final_Project/top_100_2010-2020_csv.csv")
```

#3 Kable 

```{r}
install.packages("kableExtra")

# Frequency of high schools by high school type. This table will display top producing high schools of NCAA recruits. 
HS <- bar_graph_data %>% 
  group_by(High.School, HS.Type) %>%
  summarise(total=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  slice(1:10) 
```

```{r}
#Clean table
kable(HS, format = "html", booktabs = T, caption = "Top producing high schools of NCAA recruits") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))

```

```{r}
# Frequency of colleges. There's also the question of where this talent is going; this table will display top signed/committed colleges of NCAA recruits.
Coll <-bar_graph_data %>% 
  group_by(College, Status) %>% 
  summarise(total=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
print(Coll)
```

```{r}
#Clean table
kable(Coll, format = "html", booktabs = T, caption = "Top signed colleges of NCAA recruits") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```
